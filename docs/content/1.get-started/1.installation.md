# Installation

## 1. Add to existing Nuxt project

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @trpc/server@next @trpc/client@next trpc-nuxt@beta zod
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @trpc/server@next @trpc/client@next trpc-nuxt@beta zod
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @trpc/server@next @trpc/client@next trpc-nuxt@beta zod
```

::

#### Why @trpc/server?

For implementing tRPC endpoints and routers.

#### Why @trpc/client?

For making typesafe API calls from your client.

#### Why zod?

Most examples use [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for input validation and tRPC.io highly recommends it, though it isn't required.

## 2. Install module

This will transpile `trpc-nuxt` and exclude `trpc-nuxt/client` from optimized dependencies by Vite.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['trpc-nuxt/module']
})
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed the required dependencies, you are ready to start building your application.
